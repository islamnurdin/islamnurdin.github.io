                    <p>Have you ever been to summer camps? I have been too. A day ago I came back from Summer Upgrading Camp, organized by the University of Central Asia. Honestly, this is the strangest camp I have ever had.</p>

                    <p>I think this blog will be a bit boring. So don't expect big things from here. If you have any comments, you can write me on my WhatsApp number or go to contact page if you don't know my number. Happy reading!</p>

                    <h2>Strangest moment.</h2>
                    <h3>Part 1</h3>

                    <p>The summer camp was amazing. Even though it was boring in sessions, I really liked evening activities. I like the way they organize this kind of competitions. Now I am at work, writing this to understand what is happening with me.</p>

                    <p>It is happened the night before we leave Summer camp. It was party day, and everyone were dancing. I could not dance because I dont know how to dance. She was also dancing there. I promise, she dances well enough to invite me and teach how to dance. I was just repeating after her and suddenly realized I can dance haha. I left here and went to drink something cold. I drank an ice tea and came to the dancing   scene. I came near Rudeina, who dances awesome too. We were dancing and then she came to us. She seemed she wanted to dance with me. We continued dancing. .</p>

                    <p>The music is over. She talks to one boy & laughs. The music changes to slow motion dance. I feel unconfortable and invite here to dance with me. Everyone were dancing with a partner like us. She was smiling and  looking at me.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">After disco</h2>

                    <p>The disco is over. We went to our dorms. Our councellor said we can spend our last night in the game room. I packed my bag and went to the game room. I was waiting for her by playing table-tennis. She came with her best friend Aisha. She invited me to play cards. We were a wonderful partners even in a game called «fool». We were cheating on everyone. Then suddenly I don`t know where councellor Abror came, he joined us. It was understandable that she likes councellor, because when I started cheating she was revealing this and saying that I`m cheating. I felt uncomfortable and went outside. There was Aizada sitting on the window sill and scrolling Instagram feed. Aizada is a good girl and my best friend. I taked to her for a while. She said she wants to go outside for a walk & asked for going and saying to councellor to bring us outside. I went back to game room and asked for our councellor Masrur. He agreed. </p>

                    <p>After I came from walking, I couldn`t find her in game room. Someone said that they went to the third floor for beautiful view. We, with all of our people that were in the game room went to the third floor and I couldn`t find her. </p>

                    <blockquote>Feel that need for speed!.</blockquote>

                    <p>We came back and I played Uno a bit. It was a bit boring so that I really wanted to sleep. I went to sleep.My councellor Sheyroz woke me up. I ate one fried egg and went to my bus.</p>

                    <h2>Strangest moment.</h2>
                    <h3>Part 2</h3>

                    <p>I ordered a place in bus for me and my friend Nurgazy. I said goodbye to everyone and came back into  the bus. I saw her again, she was sitting in the backside of our seat.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/20170704_165554.jpg" alt="">
                        <h5 class="subtitle"> View from UCA campus</h5>
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>
                    She called me and said: `I want to sit with you`. I agreed and sat with her. Suddenly I felt I betrayed my friend. I explained everything to Nurgazy. He understood.</p>

                    <p>We were sitting together and sleeping. Everyone were sleeping by hugging each other except us. After about 2 hours she said she wants to lay. She seemed sad. I didn`t know what to do and waited for a while. After couple of minutes, she said it again. I didn't want to leave, so I hugged her. She was sleeping on my shoulder and me bending over her had. It was an amazing sleep I have ever had. Hugging each other. On the other hand, it was pretty strange, because I have never tried it. I felt that  something  touched my heart & it was beating very fast.</p>

                    <p>She then woke up. We went to the toilet and came back to our seats. I sat with Nurgazy for a while. And came back to her place again. We started sleeping by hugging each other. I didn't want to go from there. She then whispered: `Our paths are different`. She said that we`ll never meet again.</p>

                    <p>We both felt sad. Really. It was sad because I fell in love with her. </p>

                    <p>She was different from others. She was funny everyday. She wanted me to smile more and more. She was always saying that I am serious and I smile rarely. She wanted me to smile everyday.</p>

                    <p>From this camp I understood a lot of things. I understood, that I need to be happy and smile more and more. She taught me how smile can change your whole day. She is fabulous. </p>

                    <p>I love her.</p>
